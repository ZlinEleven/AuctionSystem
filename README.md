# AuctionSystem
Homework #6 of my CSE214 Data Structures class. Auctions can either be manually created or taken from an XML file using a data extraction tool called Big Data Jar. Auctions are stored in a hashmap inside an AuctionTable object. The user is prompted for commands that interacts with an AuctionTable object

Things I learned:
 - Hash maps
 - Simple data extraction
 - Serialization of an application
